<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
At first I was very intimidated attempting this assignment because I was not 100% sure what I was doing but after seeing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxua_1vyFck">Youtube link</a> from Samvel Vardanyan I was able to set up the first few steps to this blog.

Once everything was set up I started to play around with the editor and was enjoying seeing the changes I was making in Visual Studio Code being transferred to my browser. It felt like magic. Since I am learning HTML in my CIT 384 class I decided to put it into practice by adding headers, links, and formatting.
<h3>What I Learned</h3>
Used Jekyll for the first time
</p>

<b>How to add Permalinks</b>
<p>
I wanted to to clean up my URL so I added a permalink so I can easily switch to my other Blog pages just by changing the number if I wanted to. I find it cleaner than a link with dates and string.
{% highlight html %}
permalink: "/Blog-0/"
{% endhighlight %}
</p>


<h3>What I Struggled with</h3>

My biggest struggle was being able syncing my files to my repository.
